# Development Log - Issue #3 (Session 2)

**Date:** 2025-07-23
**Issue:** #3 - CIの初期設定を行う
**Session:** 2 (Previous session was interrupted)

## Summary of Actions

### Previous Session (Interrupted)

- **Objective**: Initial setup of CI pipelines as per Issue #3.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Implemented CI pipeline updates in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
    - Enabled lint and format checks.
    - Integrated Nx `affected` commands for efficient linting and testing of only changed projects.
    - Added `pnpm audit` for dependency vulnerability scanning.
  - Resolved CodeQL duplication: Removed the custom `codeql-analysis.yml` workflow file to rely on GitHub's default CodeQL analysis, reducing maintenance overhead.
- **Commit Status**: Changes were committed to the `enhancement/3-setup-ci` branch.

### Current Session

- **Objective**: Resume work on Issue #3, finalize and create a Pull Request.
- **Actions Taken**:
  1.  **Status Confirmation**: Verified the current state of Issue #3 (OPEN), local Git status (`enhancement/3-setup-ci` branch with committed changes), recent commit history, and confirmed no existing Pull Request. Noted an untracked `dev-records` directory.
  2.  **Issue Comment Update**: Posted a detailed comment to Issue #3 summarizing the work completed in the previous session (CI pipeline updates and CodeQL duplication resolution).
  3.  **.gitignore Verification**: Confirmed that `dev-records/` was already correctly listed in `.gitignore`, so no action was needed for it.
  4.  **Remote Push**: Pushed the local `enhancement/3-setup-ci` branch to the remote GitHub repository.
  5.  **Pull Request Creation**: Created a Pull Request from `enhancement/3-setup-ci` to `main` with a descriptive title and body, linking it to Issue #3.
  6.  **Error Analysis (Post-Action)**: Investigated recurring "command not found" errors observed during `gh issue comment` and `gh pr create` commands.
      - **Root Cause**: Identified that the errors were caused by unescaped backticks (`` ` ``) within the `--body` argument passed to `run_shell_command`. Bash interpreted these as command substitutions, leading to errors for non-existent commands (e.g., `ci.yml`).
      - **Impact**: Confirmed that despite the shell errors, the `gh` commands successfully processed the arguments and posted the intended content to GitHub.
  7.  **Re-prevention Strategy**: Formulated a strategy to always escape shell-special characters (like backticks) when they are intended as literal text within `run_shell_command` arguments.
  8.  **Documentation Update**: Modified `GEMINI.md` to:
      - Add a "Tool Usage Best Practices" section, specifically detailing the need for shell command escaping.
      - Add a "Session Review and Continuous Improvement" section, outlining the process for regular self-reflection and guideline updates.
      - Updated the "Quick Reference" section to include links to the new sections.

## Decisions Made

- To prioritize confirming the state of the interrupted work before proceeding.
- To update the GitHub Issue with progress before creating a PR for better traceability.
- To thoroughly investigate and document the `run_shell_command` error to prevent future occurrences and improve tool usage.
- To formalize the session review process and tool usage best practices by updating `GEMINI.md`.

## Issues Encountered

- Unexpected interruption of the previous development session.
- Misleading "command not found" errors from `run_shell_command` due to unescaped backticks in string arguments, causing initial confusion about command success.

## Technical Context / Tools Used

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Used for viewing issues (`gh issue view`), commenting on issues (`gh issue comment`), listing PRs (`gh pr list`), and creating PRs (`gh pr create`).
- **Git**: Used for checking status (`git status`), viewing logs (`git log`), and pushing branches (`git push`).
- **`run_shell_command`**: The primary tool used to execute shell commands, which highlighted the shell escaping issue.
- **`read_file` / `replace`**: Used for reading and modifying the `GEMINI.md` documentation.
- **Bash Shell Interpretation**: Understanding how Bash handles special characters (e.g., backticks for command substitution) was crucial for diagnosing the error.
