# Development Log - Issue 155 - Session 1

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Branch:** feat/155-refactor-spotify-automation
**Author:** Gemini Agent

## Summary of Activities

- **Analysis & Documentation**:
    - Analyzed the issue regarding hardcoded browser binary paths causing portability issues.
    - Created specification documents:
        - `docs/issues/155/requirements.md`
        - `docs/issues/155/design.md`
        - `docs/issues/155/tasks.md`
    - Verified that the DevContainer environment already sets `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to `/ms-playwright`.

- **Implementation**:
    - Removed the code block in `src/features/spotifyUploader.ts` that forced `process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to `/ms-playwright`.
    - Removed the hardcoded `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` environment variable override in `tests/e2e/cli.spec.ts`.

- **Verification**:
    - Ran unit tests (`nx test spotify-automation`) - Passed.
    - Ran E2E tests (`nx e2e spotify-automation`) - Passed.
    - Ran affected tests (`nx affected:test`) - Passed.

- **Deployment**:
    - Created Pull Request #164.

## Decisions

- Relied on Playwright's standard browser resolution logic for non-DevContainer environments.
- Relied on existing environment variables in the DevContainer configuration to maintain compatibility there.
