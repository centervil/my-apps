# Development Log: 2025-07-22

**Issue:** #0 (Initial Project Setup)
**Session:** 1

## Summary

This session focused on establishing a comprehensive, professional-grade development foundation for the my-apps monorepo. All decisions were documented in `GEMINI.md` to serve as a living guide for the project.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Technology Stack Finalized**: Agreed on TypeScript, Playwright, `@playwright/test`, pnpm, ESLint, Prettier, and GitHub Actions.
2.  **Project Scaffolding**: Created the initial directory structure for the `spotify-podcast-automation` project within the `packages/` directory.
3.  **CI/CD & DevSecOps Setup**:
    - Implemented a GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) for automated Playwright testing.
    - Integrated GitHub CodeQL (`codeql-analysis.yml`) for static application security testing (SAST).
4.  **Development Workflow Definition**:
    - Established and documented an **Issue-Driven Development (IDD)** model.
    - Defined guidelines for **Issue granularity** and the handling of new discoveries.
    - Formalized a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** cycle (Red-Green-Refactor).
5.  **Guideline Documentation**:
    - Created `GEMINI.md` to document all project standards.
    - Defined **Commit Guidelines** based on Conventional Commits and the principle of Atomic Commits.
6.  **Template Implementation**:
    - Created a `.github/pull_request_template.md` to standardize PRs.
    - Created a `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` to ensure high-quality Issue creation.
7.  **Initial Commit**: All initial setup files and documentation were committed and pushed to the remote `main` branch.

## Next Steps

- The user will perform a task breakdown for the `spotify-podcast-automation` project and create Issues on GitHub.
- The next session will begin by tackling the first of these Issues.
