# Development Log: 2025-10-12, Issue #87, Session 1

## Summary of Activities

*   **Initial Analysis**:
    *   Analyzed the audit report for the `spotify-automation` project generated by the `/audit` command.
    *   Identified that the highest priority was addressing the security vulnerabilities reported by Dependabot (Issue #87).

*   **Specification and Planning**:
    *   Switched to a new branch `feat/87-security-address-3-vulnerabilities-found-by-dependabot-2-high-1-low`.
    *   Generated specification documents (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) for issue #87 and saved them in `docs/issues/87/`.

*   **Vulnerability Remediation**:
    *   Executed `pnpm audit` to get a detailed report of the 2 vulnerabilities (`axios` and `tmp`).
    *   Ran `pnpm up --latest` to update all project dependencies to their latest versions.
    *   Confirmed that all vulnerabilities were resolved by running `pnpm audit` again, which reported no known vulnerabilities.

*   **Verification and Testing**:
    *   Ensured no regressions were introduced by the dependency updates by running the test suite for `spotify-automation` (`pnpm exec nx test spotify-automation`), which passed.
    *   Verified that the primary scripts (`upload` and `test:cli`) for the `spotify-automation` project were still functional.

*   **Commit and Pull Request**:
    *   Committed the updated `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, along with the new specification documents.
    *   Pushed the branch to the remote repository.
    *   Created Pull Request #88 to merge the changes into the `main` branch.
    *   Monitored the CI checks for the PR until they all passed successfully.

*   **Final E2E Check**:
    *   Ran `pnpm exec nx affected:test` to ensure that the changes did not negatively impact any other projects in the monorepo. All tests passed.
