# Development Log - Issue #9

**Date:** 2025-07-30
**Issue:** feat(spotify-podcast-automation): Spotify for Creators ログイン機能の実装

## Session 1 Summary

**Objective:** Implement login functionality for Spotify for Creators, focusing on Page Object Model and TDD.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Initial Review:**
    - Reviewed `packages/spotify-podcast-automation/src/pages/loginPage.ts`, `packages/spotify-podcast-automation/tests/login.spec.ts`, and `packages/spotify-podcast-automation/.env.example`.
    - Confirmed `playwright.config.ts` is set up to load environment variables.

2.  **Locator Refinement:**
    - Updated locators in `packages/spotify-podcast-automation/src/pages/loginPage.ts` to use more resilient Playwright best practices (e.g., `getByLabel`, `getByRole`) instead of `page.locator('input[name="username"]')`.

3.  **Troubleshooting "rimraf: callback function required" Error:**
    - **Attempt 1: Reinstall dependencies:** Deleted `node_modules` and reinstalled with `pnpm install`. The error persisted.
    - **Attempt 2: Run tests with `--headed` and `--project=chromium`:** Attempted to run tests in headed mode for visual debugging. Encountered "No named projects are specified in the configuration file" error, which was misleading as 'chromium' was defined. The `rimraf` error remained the primary blocker.
    - **Attempt 3: Inspect `package.json` files:** Searched root and package-specific `package.json` files for `rimraf` scripts. No direct usage found.
    - **Attempt 4: Search `pnpm-lock.yaml`:** Searched `pnpm-lock.yaml` for `rimraf` to identify its source. No direct entry found, suggesting it's a transitive dependency.
    - **Attempt 5: Update all dependencies:** Ran `pnpm up --latest` to update all project dependencies. The `rimraf` error persisted.
    - **Attempt 6: Minimal test file:** Created and ran a minimal test file (`minimal.spec.ts`) to isolate the issue. The `rimraf` error still occurred, confirming it's a setup/dependency issue rather than test code.
    - **Attempt 7: Review `pnpm install` logs:** Examined `pnpm install --reporter=ndjson` output. No clear indication of the `rimraf` issue, only expected "Unsupported platform" warnings.
    - **Attempt 8: Add `rimraf` as dev dependency:** Attempted to add `rimraf` as a dev dependency to the root `package.json` using `pnpm add -D -w rimraf`. This action was cancelled by the user.

**Current Status:**

The `rimraf: callback function required` error is still preventing tests from running. The last attempted action to explicitly add `rimraf` as a dev dependency was cancelled by the user.
