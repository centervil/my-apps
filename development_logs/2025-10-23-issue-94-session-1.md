# Development Log - 2025-10-23 - Issue #94 - Session 1

## Summary of Work

*   **Initial Implementation:**
    *   Modified `spotifyUploader.ts` to launch Playwright in headless mode (`headless: true`).
    *   Refactored the authentication logic in `spotifyUploader.ts` to use the `SPOTIFY_AUTH_PATH` environment variable, with a fallback to the default path.
    *   Updated the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to include a new job for running Playwright tests for the `spotify-automation` app. This job creates the auth file from a secret and sets the `SPOTIFY_AUTH_PATH` environment variable.
    *   Updated `apps/ui-automations/spotify-automation/README.md` to document the new authentication flow and the `SPOTIFY_AUTH_PATH` environment variable.

*   **Testing and Debugging:**
    *   Ran the `spotify-automation` tests, which failed with a timeout error.
    *   Analyzed the error and determined that an in-app message overlay was obstructing the "Publish" button.
    *   Fixed the issue by adding logic to `src/pages/NewEpisodePage.ts` to detect and close the overlay before clicking the publish button.
    *   Re-ran the tests, and all tests passed successfully.

*   **Pull Request:**
    *   Committed all changes.
    *   Created a pull request (#98) for the changes.
    *   Monitored the CI pipeline until all checks passed.
