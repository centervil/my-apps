I have analyzed the project and confirmed that the Google Drive integration is not yet implemented. The file `src/libs/googleDrive.ts` does not exist, and the main `scripts/upload.ts` script does not contain any Google Drive-related logic.

This issue correctly captures the need to implement this feature. The implementation should include:

1.  Creating the `src/libs/googleDrive.ts` file.
2.  Adding the necessary logic to download files from Google Drive.
3.  Integrating this functionality into the `scripts/upload.ts` script, possibly behind a new command-line flag like `--from-google-drive`.
4.  Adding E2E tests for the Google Drive integration.
