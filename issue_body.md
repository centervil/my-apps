**Problem:** The `security-news-agent` cannot be run without valid API keys for Google Gemini, LangChain, and Tavily. This includes the `--test-mode`, which fails at startup if the keys are not present. This creates a significant barrier to entry for new users who may want to try the agent, and for developers who want to contribute to the project without needing to sign up for three separate services.

**Solution:** This series of changes introduces a true test mode that works without any API keys. When the agent is run with the `--test-mode` flag and API keys are not found in the environment, the application now:
1.  Bypasses the strict API key validation at startup.
2.  Injects mock clients for the Tavily, Gemini, and LangChain services.
3.  Uses pre-defined mock data to allow the entire agent workflow to run from end to end, producing a sample report based on the mock data.

**Benefits:**
*   **Improved User Experience:** New users can now immediately run the agent in `--test-mode` to see it in action and inspect the output format.
*   **Improved Developer Experience:** Developers can work on most parts of the agent (e.g., workflow logic, output rendering, new features) without needing to provide their own API keys.
*   **Better Testing:** The mock clients provide a stable, deterministic way to test the agent's logic without relying on external, non-deterministic APIs.

**Additional Fixes:** In the course of implementing this feature, numerous bugs and brittle tests in the unit test suite were also fixed, improving the overall stability and reliability of the project's tests. This includes fixing incorrect patch targets, race conditions in tests, and error handling logic.
