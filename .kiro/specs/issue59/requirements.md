# Requirements for Issue #59: Resolve CI error

## 1. User Story

As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to pass successfully so that I can merge my changes with confidence.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

- The `Lint and Format Check` job in the CI pipeline must pass.
- All linting errors related to unused variables in `apps/ui-automations/spotify-automation/src/auth/authManager.ts` and `apps/ui-automations/spotify-automation/scripts/saveAuth.ts` must be resolved.
- No new linting errors or test failures should be introduced.
- Changes must be limited to fixing the specified linting errors. No unrelated formatting changes should be included.
