# Design for Issue #59: Resolve CI error

## 1. Overview

The goal is to resolve the CI failure caused by linting errors. The errors are all related to unused variables in the TypeScript code. The fix must be narrowly scoped to only the files and lines causing the errors.

## 2. Solution Design

The solution is to identify and remove the unused variables from the source code. This is a low-risk change as it does not affect the application's logic.

### 2.1. Files to be Modified

- `apps/ui-automations/spotify-automation/src/auth/authManager.ts`
- `apps/ui-automations/spotify-automation/scripts/saveAuth.ts`

### 2.2. Changes

- **In `authManager.ts`**:
  - Remove the unused `path` import.
  - In `catch` blocks where the `error` variable is not used, change `catch (error)` to `catch`.
- **In `saveAuth.ts`**:
  - Remove the unused `Page` type import from `@playwright/test`.

## 3. Test Strategy

After applying the changes, I will run the linter directly on the modified files to verify that the errors are resolved.

- `pnpm eslint apps/ui-automations/spotify-automation/src/auth/authManager.ts`
- `pnpm eslint apps/ui-automations/spotify-automation/scripts/saveAuth.ts`

This targeted approach avoids making unrelated changes to other files. **No project-wide formatters will be run.**
