# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to disable flake8's E501 "line too long" error in the repository's CI pipeline. The current CI checks are generating numerous E501 violations that require significant effort to fix, and the cost-benefit analysis suggests that ignoring this specific rule is more practical for this repository.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flake8's E501 "line too long" error to be disabled in the CI pipeline, so that I don't have to spend excessive time fixing line length violations that don't significantly impact code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flake8 configuration is updated THEN the E501 error SHALL be ignored during linting
2. WHEN CI pipeline runs flake8 THEN no E501 errors SHALL be reported
3. WHEN the configuration changes are committed THEN they SHALL be properly reflected in the repository

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the flake8 configuration to be properly documented and centralized, so that all developers understand which rules are active and why certain rules are disabled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flake8 configuration is modified THEN it SHALL be placed in an appropriate configuration file (.flake8, setup.cfg, or tox.ini)
2. WHEN the configuration is updated THEN it SHALL include clear documentation about why E501 is disabled
3. WHEN developers run flake8 locally THEN they SHALL get the same results as the CI pipeline

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline, I want to continue enforcing other flake8 rules while ignoring E501, so that code quality standards are maintained for other important linting rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flake8 runs in CI THEN all rules except E501 SHALL be enforced
2. WHEN other flake8 errors exist THEN the CI pipeline SHALL still fail appropriately
3. WHEN E501 violations exist THEN they SHALL be ignored and not cause CI failure
