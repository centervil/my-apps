# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create flake8 configuration file
  - Create `.flake8` file in repository root with E501 ignore setting
  - Add comprehensive configuration including exclude patterns and documentation
  - Include clear comments explaining why E501 is disabled
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Validate configuration syntax and functionality
  - Test that flake8 can successfully parse the new configuration file
  - Create test files with intentional E501 violations to verify they are ignored
  - Verify that other flake8 errors are still detected and reported
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Verify CI pipeline integration
  - Check existing GitHub Actions workflows to ensure they use the flake8 configuration
  - Run CI pipeline with test cases containing E501 violations
  - Confirm that E501 errors do not cause CI failures
  - Verify that other flake8 errors still cause appropriate CI failures
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Test local development workflow
  - Verify that developers running flake8 locally get the same results as CI
  - Test configuration works across all Python projects in the monorepo
  - Ensure configuration is properly applied to security-news-agent and other Python apps
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 5. Document and commit changes
  - Commit the `.flake8` configuration file with appropriate commit message
  - Ensure changes are properly reflected in the repository
  - Verify the configuration persists across different development environments
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1_
