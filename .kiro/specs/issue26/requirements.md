# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for renaming the repository from "UI-Automation" to "my-apps". This change involves updating the repository name on GitHub and ensuring all related configurations, documentation, and references are properly updated to reflect the new name.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a repository owner, I want to rename the repository from "UI-Automation" to "my-apps", so that the repository name better reflects its broader scope as a multi-application workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository rename is initiated THEN GitHub SHALL update the repository name from "UI-Automation" to "my-apps"
2. WHEN the repository is renamed THEN GitHub SHALL automatically create redirects from the old repository URL to the new one
3. WHEN the repository is renamed THEN all existing clone URLs SHALL be automatically redirected to the new repository name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all CI/CD configurations to work correctly after the repository rename, so that automated workflows continue to function without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is renamed THEN all GitHub Actions workflows SHALL continue to function correctly
2. IF external CI/CD systems are configured THEN they SHALL be updated to reference the new repository name
3. IF webhooks are configured THEN they SHALL be updated to point to the new repository URL
4. IF deployment configurations exist THEN they SHALL be updated to reference the new repository name

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading the project documentation, I want all documentation to reflect the correct repository name, so that there is no confusion about the project identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is renamed THEN the README file SHALL be updated to reference the new repository name
2. IF Wiki pages exist THEN they SHALL be updated to reference the new repository name
3. IF documentation files exist THEN they SHALL be updated to reference the new repository name
4. WHEN the repository is renamed THEN issue templates SHALL be updated if they contain repository-specific references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to properly close this issue after completing all rename tasks, so that the task is marked as complete and tracked properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all repository rename tasks are completed THEN issue #26 SHALL be closed
2. WHEN the issue is closed THEN it SHALL include a summary of completed actions
