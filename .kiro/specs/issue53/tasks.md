# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up linting validation environment
  - Create baseline flake8 report to track current errors
  - Set up test environment to validate changes incrementally
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Refactor complex functions to reduce complexity
- [x] 2.1 Refactor `run_workflow` function in `__main__.py`
  - Extract environment setup logic into `_setup_workflow_environment` method
  - Extract workflow execution logic into `_execute_workflow_steps` method  
  - Extract result handling logic into `_handle_workflow_results` method
  - Ensure complexity score drops below 10
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2.2 Refactor `test_minimal_workflow_execution` method in `test_real_apis.py`
  - Extract test setup logic into `_setup_test_environment` method
  - Extract workflow execution and validation into `_execute_and_validate_workflow` method
  - Extract result verification into `_verify_test_results` method
  - Ensure complexity score drops below 10
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Fix line break formatting issues (W503 violations)
- [x] 3.1 Fix W503 violations in `processing/nodes.py`
  - Move line break from before to after binary operator on line 428
  - Ensure code readability is maintained
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3.2 Fix W503 violations in `processing/workflow.py`
  - Move line break from before to after binary operator on line 210
  - Ensure code readability is maintained
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3.3 Fix W503 violations in `tests/api/test_real_apis.py`
  - Move line break from before to after binary operator on line 210
  - Ensure test functionality is preserved
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3.4 Fix W503 violations in `tests/integration/test_workflow.py`
  - Move line breaks from before to after binary operators on lines 150, 176, and 421
  - Ensure test functionality is preserved
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3.5 Fix W503 violations in `tests/unit/test_config.py`
  - Move line breaks from before to after binary operators on lines 159, 163, and 167
  - Ensure test functionality is preserved
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Fix whitespace formatting issues
- [x] 4.1 Fix E226 violation in `tests/api/test_real_apis.py`
  - Add proper whitespace around arithmetic operator on line 257 (`i+1` should be `i + 1`)
  - Ensure test functionality is preserved
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Validate all fixes and ensure CI compliance
- [x] 5.1 Run comprehensive flake8 validation
  - Execute flake8 on entire codebase to confirm zero errors
  - Generate statistics report to verify all issues are resolved
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [x] 5.2 Execute complete test suite validation
  - Run all unit tests to ensure no regressions in refactored functions
  - Run all integration tests to verify system functionality
  - Run API tests to confirm external integrations work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 5.3 Verify CI pipeline compliance
  - Confirm that linting checks pass in CI environment
  - Validate that all GitHub Actions workflows complete successfully
  - _Requirements: 1.2_
