# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for fixing linting errors in the Security News Agent application. The solution focuses on three main areas: reducing function complexity through refactoring, fixing line break formatting issues, and correcting whitespace problems around operators.

## Architecture

### Current Issues Analysis

The linting errors fall into three categories:

1. **Complexity Issues (C901)**: Two functions exceed the complexity threshold
   - `run_workflow` in `__main__.py` (complexity: 15)
   - `test_minimal_workflow_execution` in `test_real_apis.py` (complexity: 12)

2. **Line Break Issues (W503)**: Nine instances of line breaks before binary operators
   - Located in `nodes.py`, `workflow.py`, `test_real_apis.py`, `test_workflow.py`, and `test_config.py`

3. **Whitespace Issues (E226)**: One instance of missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
   - Located in `test_real_apis.py`

### Design Strategy

#### 1. Function Complexity Reduction

- **Extract Method Pattern**: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused methods
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each extracted method should have one clear purpose
- **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure no behavioral changes during refactoring

#### 2. Line Break Formatting

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Move line breaks to after binary operators instead of before
- **Consistent Style**: Apply uniform formatting across all affected files
- **Readability Maintenance**: Ensure changes improve or maintain code readability

#### 3. Whitespace Correction

- **Operator Spacing**: Add proper whitespace around arithmetic operators
- **Style Consistency**: Follow Python style guidelines for operator formatting

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Main Module Refactoring (`__main__.py`)

**Current Structure:**

```python
def run_workflow(config, topic, format_type, output_dir, debug):
    # 15 complexity points - too complex
```

**Proposed Structure:**

```python
def run_workflow(config, topic, format_type, output_dir, debug):
    # Main orchestration - reduced complexity

def _setup_workflow_environment(config, debug):
    # Environment setup logic

def _execute_workflow_steps(workflow, state):
    # Workflow execution logic

def _handle_workflow_results(result, format_type, output_dir):
    # Result processing logic
```

### 2. Test Module Refactoring (`test_real_apis.py`)

**Current Structure:**

```python
def test_minimal_workflow_execution(self, limited_config, tmp_path):
    # 12 complexity points - too complex
```

**Proposed Structure:**

```python
def test_minimal_workflow_execution(self, limited_config, tmp_path):
    # Main test orchestration - reduced complexity

def _setup_test_environment(self, limited_config, tmp_path):
    # Test setup logic

def _execute_and_validate_workflow(self, workflow, state):
    # Workflow execution and validation logic

def _verify_test_results(self, result, tmp_path):
    # Result verification logic
```

### 3. Line Break Formatting Strategy

**Before (W503 violation):**

```python
condition = (some_long_expression
             and another_expression
             or third_expression)
```

**After (PEP 8 compliant):**

```python
condition = (some_long_expression and
             another_expression or
             third_expression)
```

## Data Models

No new data models are required for this refactoring. All existing data structures and interfaces will be preserved.

## Error Handling

### Refactoring Safety

- **Unit Test Coverage**: Ensure all refactored functions maintain existing test coverage
- **Integration Testing**: Verify that refactored components work correctly together
- **Behavioral Preservation**: Use existing tests to validate that functionality remains unchanged

### Rollback Strategy

- **Incremental Changes**: Apply fixes in small, reviewable commits
- **Test-Driven Approach**: Run tests after each change to catch regressions early
- **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes and enable easy rollback if needed

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Pre-Refactoring Validation

- Run existing test suite to establish baseline
- Document current test coverage metrics
- Identify any existing test failures

### 2. Refactoring Validation

- Run tests after each function extraction
- Verify that complexity metrics improve
- Ensure no new test failures are introduced

### 3. Post-Refactoring Verification

- Run complete test suite to ensure all functionality works
- Verify flake8 passes with zero errors
- Confirm CI pipeline runs successfully

### 4. Linting Validation

- Run flake8 after each fix to verify error resolution
- Use `--show-source` flag to confirm specific issues are resolved
- Generate statistics to track progress

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Complexity Reduction

1. Refactor `run_workflow` function in `__main__.py`
2. Refactor `test_minimal_workflow_execution` method in `test_real_apis.py`
3. Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved

### Phase 2: Formatting Fixes

1. Fix W503 line break issues across all affected files
2. Fix E226 whitespace issue in `test_real_apis.py`
3. Verify formatting consistency

### Phase 3: Validation

1. Run complete flake8 check to ensure all errors are resolved
2. Execute full test suite to confirm no regressions
3. Verify CI pipeline passes successfully
