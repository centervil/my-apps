# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for fixing linting errors in the Security News Agent application. The current codebase has multiple flake8 violations that need to be resolved to maintain code quality standards and ensure CI pipeline success. These errors include complexity violations (C901), line break formatting issues (W503), and missing whitespace around operators (E226).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Security News Agent codebase to pass all flake8 linting checks, so that code quality standards are maintained and CI pipelines run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flake8 is run on the Security News Agent codebase THEN it SHALL return zero errors
2. WHEN the CI pipeline runs linting checks THEN it SHALL pass without any flake8 violations
3. WHEN code complexity is analyzed THEN all functions SHALL have a complexity score below the configured threshold

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want complex functions to be refactored into smaller, more manageable pieces, so that the code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `run_workflow` function in `__main__.py` is analyzed THEN it SHALL have a complexity score below 10
2. WHEN the `test_minimal_workflow_execution` method in `test_real_apis.py` is analyzed THEN it SHALL have a complexity score below 10
3. WHEN functions are refactored THEN their original functionality SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN functions are split THEN each new function SHALL have a single, clear responsibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting throughout the codebase, so that the code is readable and follows Python style guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN line breaks are used with binary operators THEN they SHALL follow PEP 8 guidelines (break after operators, not before)
2. WHEN arithmetic operators are used THEN they SHALL have proper whitespace around them
3. WHEN formatting changes are made THEN the code's functionality SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN the codebase is formatted THEN it SHALL be consistent across all files
