# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add Node.js and pnpm setup to Security News Agent Tests workflow
  - Modify `.github/workflows/security-news-test.yml` to include Node.js and pnpm setup steps
  - Add the setup steps after Python setup but before Poetry installation
  - Use the same versions and configuration as the main CI workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Add Node.js dependencies installation step
  - Add step to run `pnpm install --unsafe-perm` after Node.js setup
  - Ensure this step runs in the workspace root directory (not security-news-agent subdirectory)
  - Position this step before the Poetry dependency installation
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 1.2_

- [x] 3. Verify workflow step ordering and configuration
  - Ensure all new steps are properly positioned in the workflow
  - Verify that working directory settings are correct for each step
  - Confirm that the linting step will have access to nx command after changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Test the workflow changes
  - Create a test branch with the workflow changes
  - Trigger the Security News Agent Tests workflow to verify it runs successfully
  - Confirm that the "Run linting and formatting checks" step completes without errors
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 5. Validate that existing functionality is preserved
  - Verify that all Python version matrix jobs run successfully
  - Confirm that test execution, coverage upload, and other steps work as before
  - Ensure no regression in workflow performance or reliability
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 1.1_
