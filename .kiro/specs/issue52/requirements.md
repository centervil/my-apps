# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses CI errors in the Security News Agent Tests workflow. The workflow is failing on the "Run linting and formatting checks" step because it attempts to run `npx nx lint security-news-agent` without properly setting up Node.js and pnpm dependencies first. The workflow needs to be fixed to ensure proper dependency setup before running Nx commands.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to run successfully so that I can merge pull requests without CI failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Security News Agent Tests workflow runs THEN the "Run linting and formatting checks" step SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN the workflow executes `npx nx lint security-news-agent` THEN it SHALL have access to the nx command and all required dependencies
3. WHEN the linting step completes THEN it SHALL properly execute `poetry run flake8 src/ tests/` as defined in the project.json

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI workflow to have proper dependency management so that all tools are available when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow starts THEN it SHALL install Node.js and pnpm before running any Nx commands
2. WHEN pnpm is installed THEN it SHALL install all workspace dependencies including Nx
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the workflow SHALL be able to execute Nx commands successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI workflow to be consistent across all jobs so that the setup is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple Python versions are tested THEN each job SHALL have the same Node.js and pnpm setup
2. WHEN the workflow is updated THEN it SHALL follow the same pattern as other successful workflows in the repository
3. WHEN the fix is applied THEN it SHALL not break any existing functionality
