# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Issue30で実装されたセキュリティニュース収集AIエージェントの品質向上を目的とした改善プロジェクトです。現在の実装は単一ファイルに全機能が集約されており、テストが不十分で実際の動作確認ができていない状況です。本プロジェクトでは、コードの分割、テスト整備、動作確認を通じて、保守性と信頼性を向上させます。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the security news agent code to be properly modularized, so that I can easily maintain and extend individual components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN the main script SHALL be split into logical modules (config, search, processing, output)
2. WHEN each module is examined THEN it SHALL have a single responsibility and clear interface
3. WHEN the code structure is analyzed THEN it SHALL follow Python packaging best practices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all components, so that I can verify functionality without requiring external API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL cover all core functions with mocked external dependencies
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL not require actual API keys or network access
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL be at least 80% for core business logic
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that can verify the end-to-end workflow, so that I can ensure the pipeline works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL test the complete workflow from news collection to report generation
2. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL use mock data that simulates real API responses
3. WHEN the workflow is tested THEN it SHALL verify that valid Markdown output is generated
4. WHEN errors occur in the pipeline THEN they SHALL be properly handled and logged

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to test the system with real APIs in a controlled manner, so that I can verify actual functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL use a limited set of test queries to minimize API usage
2. WHEN real API testing is performed THEN it SHALL generate a sample report for verification
3. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN test execution completes THEN it SHALL provide clear success/failure feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running operations
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GitHub Actions workflow to be testable, so that I can verify the CI/CD pipeline works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow is triggered THEN it SHALL run tests before executing the main pipeline
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the workflow SHALL not proceed to report generation
3. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL cache dependencies to improve performance
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL be validated before committing
