# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements GitHub Actions workflows that leverage Gemini CLI to enhance the development process. The implementation will be based on the reference article (https://zenn.dev/makumaaku/articles/15f56ac617a3af) and the example repository (centervil/my-tasks). The goal is to integrate AI-powered automation into the CI/CD pipeline to improve code quality, documentation, and development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions to automatically utilize Gemini CLI for code analysis and improvements, so that I can maintain high code quality without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that uses Gemini CLI
2. WHEN the Gemini CLI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback as comments on the pull request
3. IF the analysis identifies issues THEN the system SHALL clearly document the findings in the PR comments
4. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL securely handle API keys and credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated documentation generation using Gemini CLI, so that project documentation stays current with code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL analyze the changes using Gemini CLI
2. WHEN documentation updates are needed THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate documentation updates
3. WHEN documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL create a pull request with the updated documentation
4. IF documentation generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify maintainers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Gemini CLI to assist with code review processes, so that I can receive AI-powered insights on code quality and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request contains code changes THEN the system SHALL analyze the code using Gemini CLI
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions for improvements
3. WHEN security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight them with high priority
4. WHEN best practice violations are found THEN the system SHALL suggest specific improvements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a repository administrator, I want configurable Gemini CLI workflows, so that I can customize the AI assistance based on project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the workflow THEN the system SHALL allow customization of Gemini CLI prompts
2. WHEN different project types are detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate analysis templates
3. WHEN workflow configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration before applying
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent deployment
